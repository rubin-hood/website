### [Network Whispers â€“ Interactive Particle Animation on Canvas](https://codepen.io/rubin-hood/pen/wvLypWa)

"Network Whispers" is an interactive canvas animation implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Points move randomly across a drawing area, connect with lines when in close proximity, and dynamically adjust to window resizing.Â https://codepen.io/rubin-hood/pen/wvLypWa


### [Nodes and Forces â€“ Network Visualization](https://codepen.io/rubin-hood/pen/mdZBpzM)

"Nodes and Forces" is a dynamic visualization implemented using D3.js and SVG. It showcases a network of nodes (points) and connections (lines) influenced by physics-inspired forces. The simulation combines attraction, repulsion, and collision to create an interactive and visually engaging experience.Â https://codepen.io/rubin-hood/pen/mdZBpzM


### [Glowing Dodecahedron](https://codepen.io/rubin-hood/pen/bGPLaJq)

This is an interactive 3D visualization of a dodecahedron, created using the 3D library Three.js. The dodecahedron features glowing edges and transparent faces with a neon effect, displayed on a black background with continuous rotation.Â https://codepen.io/rubin-hood/pen/bGPLaJq
