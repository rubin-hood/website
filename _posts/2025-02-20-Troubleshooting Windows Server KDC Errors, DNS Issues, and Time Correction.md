"RUBIN-HOOD: Configuration refresh message: The system cannot access one or more event logs because of insufficient access rights, file corruption, or other reasons. For more information, see the Operational channel in the ServerManager-ManagementProvider error log on the target server."

## Introduction

Windows Server is a powerful operating system used for various network services, including Active Directory (AD DS), DNS, and IIS. However, errors can sometimes occur, affecting operations. This article explains how a Windows Server experiencing KDC errors, incorrect time synchronization, and DNS issues was successfully fixed.

## **1. The Problem: KDC Errors & DNS Failures**

After setting up a Windows Server with the domain **ad.rubinhood.de**, the following issues were encountered:

- The **KDC (Key Distribution Center) error** prevented successful Kerberos authentications.
- The **Windows Server Manager** displayed errors when updating roles and features.
- The **system time** was incorrect and not synchronizing automatically.

After thorough analysis, the primary cause was found to be **incorrect time settings and a lack of Kerberos synchronization**.

## **2. Solution Steps for Troubleshooting**

### **Step 1: Checking the Server Time**

Incorrect date and time synchronization can cause Kerberos errors. The current time setting was checked using:

```
w32tm /query /status
```

It was found that the server was using its **Local CMOS Clock**, which is problematic in an Active Directory environment.

### **Step 2: Configuring Correct Time Synchronization**

To ensure the server uses a **reliable time source**, synchronization with an external NTP server was configured:

```
w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"time.windows.com,0x8 ntp1.ptb.de,0x8" /syncfromflags:manual /reliable:YES /update
net stop w32time
net start w32time
w32tm /resync
```

After this configuration, `w32tm /query /status` confirmed that the server was now syncing with **ntp1.ptb.de**.

### **Step 3: Restarting the Windows Time Service**

Since some services only fully apply changes after a restart, the time service was synchronized again using:

```
w32tm /resync /nowait
```

Now, `Get-Date` displayed the correct time in **German format**.

### **Step 4: Verifying the Kerberos Service**

Once the time was synchronized, the **KDC service** status was checked:

```
Get-Service kdc
```

If the service was stopped, it was started manually with:

```
Start-Service kdc
```

### **Step 5: Checking Domain Controller Registration**

Another possible issue is an improperly registered domain controller. This was verified using:

```
nltest /dsgetdc:ad.rubinhood.de
```

If errors appeared, a **reinitialization of the domain role** might be required.

### **Step 6: Restarting the Server**

After applying all configuration changes, the server was restarted. This ensured that **all services (AD DS, DNS, Kerberos, Windows Server Manager) applied the new settings**.

After the restart, the server ran **without errors**, displaying all roles correctly in the Server Manager.

## **3. Conclusion: What Fixed the Issue?**

The primary cause of the issues was **incorrect time synchronization**, leading to Kerberos authentication failures.
By implementing the following measures, the server was successfully restored:

- **Proper NTP synchronization with a reliable time server**
- **Restarting the KDC and time services**
- **Verifying DNS and Active Directory configurations**
- **Rebooting the server to apply all changes**

These steps eliminated **all errors**, and the server is now running smoothly.

## **Additional Tips for Preventing Errors**

1. **Regularly check the time source:**
    
    ```
    w32tm /query /status
    ```
    
2. **Monitor Kerberos and DNS status frequently:**
    
    ```
    nltest /dsgetdc:ad.rubinhood.de
    Get-EventLog -LogName System -EntryType Error -Newest 5
    ```
    
3. **Plan a reboot after significant changes (time sync, DNS updates) to ensure proper application**

By following these practices, many common Windows Server issues can be proactively avoided.
