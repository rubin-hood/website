Sharing a folder in Windows allows other users on the network to access or edit files. This can be particularly useful in office environments or at home when multiple devices are connected.

Want to share a folder on your network? Follow these steps to set up folder sharing in Windows.

Go to the folder you want to share, right-click on it, and select **Properties**. Then, go to the **Sharing** tab.

Click on **Advanced Sharing** to access more options.

Check the box **Share this folder**, then click **Permissions** to set access rights.

In the **Permissions** window, select **Everyone** and check **Full Control, Change, and Read** under "Allow." Click **OK** to confirm.

Click **OK** on all windows and close the properties.
